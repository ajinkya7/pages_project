Even the most privileged learning curves go from ignorance to socialism to capitalism to indifference. From wanting to change the world to at least wanting to change one’s eating habits, life is an ongoing process of realizing our own futility. The resulting frustration manifests in conflicts personal and national. The lucky ones can channel it through art, others stumble through all of life’s pit stops contributing to credit card debt and global warming.

The western world, which also includes the metros of the east has largely overcome most physical chores leaving man more and more alone with his thoughts with very little knowledge of how to deal with them. The myths that could comfort us cannot survive in cities. And the echoes of the sub-conscious can barely be heard above the hum of electricity. All that is left is you staring at yourself in the mirror with a month’s worth of disposable income. Life has always been under Lockdown. Just that now it is more apparent.
This is where self-improvement enters, as a new form of decadence. Diet, exercise, grooming, motivation, spirituality, therapy, detox, recycling – a boot camp for the soul without ever knowing what a soul could actually mean. From sharing FitBit scores to comparing meditation sessions on Headspace, nothing can escape packaging. To be sure, this is still progress, if it makes us look inward, away from cast, creed and religion. But after the tenth School of Life video, everything starts repeating itself. The most kooky ideas are passed off as ‘New Age’, rebirth is explained as thermodynamics and free will is explained as some quantum inevitability. But none of it can make you less restive.
